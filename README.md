# Update

New versions of moodle fix this problem directly, so my work here is done

# Forumly
Forumly is a Chrome extension that improves moodle forums by displaying the entire discussion of a each topic, without the need to open the url of each comment.
**Note:**

The code currently uses the ``.innerHTML`` function which allows XSS vulnerabilities.
